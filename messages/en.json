      "trackOrders": {
        "question": "How does the AI customer support work?",
        "answer": "Our AI reads your incoming messages and responds intelligently based on your products, policies, and brand voice. It can answer questions, provide tracking info, even create orders. When something needs a human touch, it routes the conversation to your team. You stay in control."
